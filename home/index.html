  <section id="About Me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>Hello. My name is Violet, and I am a high school student at a small public school. I grew up with a strong passion for engineering, technology, and creative problem-solving. I love to create meaningful solutions, or face challenge, whether that’s in coding, engineering, or digital design.
     <p>  
     </p>
     <p>Beyond the world of technology and engineering, I enjoy snowboarding, playing Lorcanna and Dnd, and spending time outside with my dog. Though dnd I am able to boost my creativity while designing the next campain. When snowboarding I challenge myself to new tricks. These hobbies inspire how I approach challenges both academically and personally.</p>
     <p>  
     </p>
     <p>I am driven by curiosity, a love of learning, and a desire to shape the future in technological innovation. My goal is to continue growing my skills and knowledge while building projects.</p>
